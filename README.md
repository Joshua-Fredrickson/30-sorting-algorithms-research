# LAB 30 Basic Sorting

**Author**: Joshua Fredrickson

**Version**: 1.0.0 

Lab 30 is a Store API that accepts HTTP CRUD requests into a Mongo Data Base.


To use the Lab 30 application, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 
(Node Package manager), and [Mongo DB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)  will need
 to be locally installed.  Once Node.js, npm, Mongo DB have been installed, install the Lab 30 
 files.  
 Prior to starting the Lab 30 application, from the command line while you are in the Lab 30 file 
 folder, enter the command `npm i`.  This will download all needed dependencies for the 
 application to run.   


This application was deployed with the following technologies.
Node.js, npm, body-parser, dotenv, express, faker, mongoose, winston, babel, superagent, 
http-errors, jest, eslint, JavaScript
